We will store useful resources on this site to help you get started with computation here in the Parker lab. We primarily use Python and R for coding here, and operate on the computing power of [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) as well as Caltech's own [high performance computing](http://www.hpc.caltech.edu/) platform.
